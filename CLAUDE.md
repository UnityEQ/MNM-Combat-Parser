# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Run CLI capture tool (requires Administrator terminal on Windows)
python mnm.py

# Run standalone GUI combat parser (requires Administrator)
python parser/parser.py

# Common flags (mnm.py)
python mnm.py --dump-keys              # Read encryption keys from game memory and exit
python mnm.py --log-level DEBUG         # Verbose console output
python mnm.py --no-wait                 # Fail immediately if game not running
python mnm.py -p other.exe -i 10.0.0.5 # Custom process name and interface IP

# Install dependency (only external package)
pip install pycryptodome

# Syntax check after changes
python -c "import core.combat; import core.npc_database; import core.parser"
python -c "import parser.parser"

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name ZekParser --uac-admin --version-file version_info.py --collect-all pycryptodome "parser/parser.py"
```

No test framework exists. Verify changes with `python -c` imports and live capture.

## Two Entry Points

1. **`mnm.py`** — Headless CLI tool. Captures packets, decrypts, logs combat events to console + rotating log files in `logs/`. Records NPC spawns to `data/npc_database.csv`.
2. **`parser/parser.py`** — Standalone tkinter GUI named **ZekParser** (window title: `"ZekParser {APP_VERSION}"`). Fully self-contained (zero imports from `core/`). Duplicates the entire capture→decrypt→parse pipeline inline. Shows real-time combat feed + damage meter with DPS tracking. Debug logs go to `parser/logs/`. `APP_VERSION` constant (e.g. `"V1.4"`) at top of file — bump for each exe release. Keep in sync with `version_info.py` (`filevers`/`prodvers`/`FileVersion`/`ProductVersion`).

Both require Windows Administrator privileges for raw socket capture (`SIO_RCVALL`).

## Architecture

Windows-only network capture tool targeting a Unity MMO (`mnm.exe`) that uses FishNet/LiteNetLib networking. Captures raw packets, decrypts them with keys read from game memory, then parses game-level messages.

### Protocol Stack (outer → inner)

```
Raw Socket (SIO_RCVALL) → IP → UDP/TCP → [CRC32c + AES-256-CBC] → LiteNetLib Frame → Game Messages
```

### Thread Model (5 threads + main)

```
CaptureEngine ──queue──→ PacketProcessor ──→ Console/File loggers
                              ↑ reads                ↓ writes
ConnectionMonitor        CombatParser          NpcDatabase (CSV)
KeyWatcher (memory)
```

- **CaptureEngine** (`core/capture.py`): Raw socket recv loop, pushes to thread-safe queue (max 10k)
- **ConnectionMonitor** (`core/connections.py`): Polls Windows iphlpapi every 5s to track game's TCP/UDP connections. Handles 0.0.0.0 wildcard bindings via port-only matching
- **KeyWatcher** (`core/memory.py`): Reads AES/HMAC/XOR keys from IL2CPP static fields via ReadProcessMemory every 5s
- **PacketProcessor** (`mnm.py`): Main pipeline — parse IP headers, filter by game connections, decrypt, extract LiteNetLib frames, parse game messages, emit combat events, record NPCs
- **Main thread**: Stats logging every 10s, process health monitoring

The standalone GUI (`parser/parser.py`) uses the same thread model with a `CaptureBackend` class that manages lifecycle, connection, key, capture, and processing threads internally, feeding parsed events to the tkinter UI via a thread-safe queue polled with `root.after()`.

### Encryption Pipeline (`core/decrypt.py`)

Wire format: `[IV(16)] [AES-CBC ciphertext(N×16)] [HMAC(32)?] [CRC32c(4)]`

Decryption order: strip CRC from **back** → strip HMAC if key present → AES-256-CBC decrypt (IV = first 16 bytes) → PKCS7 unpad → XOR if key present. Current server only uses AES (HMAC/XOR keys are empty).

Keys live in `Client.ConnectionInfo` static class: `GameAssembly.dll + 0x544FCD8` → Il2CppClass → static_fields → offsets 0x38/0x40/0x48 for HMAC/AES/XOR byte arrays.

### Game Message Format

After LiteNetLib framing, game messages are: `[msg_id (uint16 LE)] [body]`. 355 known message types in `core/opcodes.py`. Strings on wire use LiteNetLib format: `[uint16 LE length] [UTF-8 bytes]` where length includes a trailing null byte.

LiteNetLib PacketProperty byte: bits 0-4 = property type (0=Unreliable, 1=Channeled, 12=Merged are data-bearing), bits 5-6 = connection number, bit 7 = fragmented. Merged packets contain nested LNL sub-frames.

### Key Data Structures

- `ParsedPacket` (`core/parser.py`): IP/transport header fields + raw payload + direction
- `LiteNetLibFrame` (`core/parser.py`): Parsed LNL header with property type, sequence, channel
- `GameMessage` (`core/parser.py`): msg_id + body bytes + msg_name lookup
- `CombatEvent` (`core/combat.py`): Typed event with source/target IDs, fields dict, raw body
- `NpcDatabase` (`core/npc_database.py`): Appends SpawnEntity data to `data/npc_database.csv`

### Configuration

`config.json` at project root. Key fields:

- `player_name`: Leave empty `""` — auto-detected from combat text. Only set manually if auto-detect fails.
- `server_name`: Display label for GUI title bar (e.g. `"Beta PvP"`)
- `process_name`: Target process (default `"mnm.exe"`)
- `interface_ip`: Network interface (`"auto"` for auto-detect, or explicit IP)
- `log_level`: `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARNING"`, `"ERROR"`
- `capture_filter.protocols`: `["UDP", "TCP"]`
- `capture_filter.exclude_ports`: Ports to ignore (default `[80, 443, 53]`)
- `api_enabled`: `false` to disable API submission
- `api_url`, `api_key`, `api_batch_interval`: Remote API settings for `parser/api_client.py`

## Combat Text Parsing (parser/parser.py)

Combat damage text arrives via two different opcodes:

- **EndCasting (0x0056)**: Carries spell/ability results. Has `entity_id` and `target_id` fields. Format: `[u32 entity_id] [u32 target_id] [string text]`.
- **ChatMessage (0x0040)**: Carries melee auto-attack damage and misc combat text. Channel 1 = combat text. Has **no entity IDs** — attacker/target must be resolved from text. Format: `[u32 channel] [string text] [6 trailing bytes]`.
- **0x644B (Combat Animation)**: Accompanies every melee hit. Has both entity IDs and the verb but **no damage number**. Format: `[AnimEntry attacker] [AnimEntry defender]` where `AnimEntry = [u32 entity_id] [u8 anim_type] [LiteNetLib string verb]`. Types: 0x34=attack, 0x2a=react, 0x00=none. Verbs: "slash"/"stab"/"punch"/"miss" (attack), "ouch" (react). Defender entry is all zeros on misses.

### EndCasting Patterns (6 patterns, checked in order)

1. Third-person spell: `"X's Ability hits Y for N points of Type Damage."` — `^(.+?)'s .+? hits (.+?) for \d+`
2. Local player spell: `"Your Ability hits Y for N points of damage."` — `^Your .+? hits (.+?) for \d+`
3. Local melee + damage: `"You slash Y for N points of damage."` — uses `_MELEE_VERBS` whitelist
4. Third-person melee + damage: `"Bannin slashes Y for N points of damage."` — uses `_MELEE_VERBS(?:e?s)`
5. Local melee, no damage: `"You kick Y."` — uses `_MELEE_VERBS` whitelist
6. Third-person melee, no damage: `"Lilyth kicks Y."` — uses `_MELEE_VERBS(?:e?s)`

Patterns 3-6 use a `_MELEE_VERBS` whitelist (~40 verbs) instead of `\w+` to prevent non-combat verbs like "pulls", "binds", "summons" from corrupting entity names.

### ChatCombat Patterns

ChatCombat first checks for `"for N points of"` as a universal damage indicator (no verb matching needed since the `points of` suffix prevents false positives), then parses structure:

1. Local melee: `"You [verb] [at] X [with offhand] for N ..."`
2. Local ability: `"Your Ability hits X for N ..."`
3. Third-person ability: `"Name's Ability hits X for N ..."`
4. Third-person melee: `"Name [verb]s [at] X [with offhand] for N ..."`

### Entity Resolution for ChatCombat

ChatCombat messages have no entity IDs. Resolution strategy:

1. **Temporal correlation** (`_last_hp_eid`): The target's `UpdateHealth` always arrives right before its `ChatCombat` message. The tracker records the most recent UpdateHealth entity ID and uses it if the name matches (or entity has no name yet) within 2 seconds. This correctly disambiguates when multiple NPCs share the same name.
2. **Name lookup fallback** (`_resolve_target_eid`): Iterates `self.names` looking for a matching name. Prefers alive entities (encounter not dead) over dead ones.
3. **Local player**: Uses `_local_player_eid` (detected from outbound Autoattack/ChangeTarget `entity_id`, or "Your..."/"You..." EndCasting text). If unknown, ChatCombat "You..." damage queues in `_pending_local_dmg` until detection fires.

### Local Player Detection and the `"_local"` Sentinel

Before the local player's entity ID is known, autoattack/target tracking uses the string `"_local"` as a placeholder in `_autoattack_on`, `autoattack_target`, and `last_attacker`. Three detection paths set `_local_player_eid`:

1. **Autoattack OUT** / **ChangeTarget OUT**: Outbound packets carry the local player's `entity_id` — `_mark_local_player(eid)` is called immediately. This is the primary detection path and works for pure melee players.
2. **EndCasting text**: "Your Ability hits..." / "You slash..." patterns call `_mark_local_player(eid)`.
3. **Heal text**: "heals you" EndCasting calls `_mark_local_player(target_id)`.

When `_mark_local_player` fires, it retroactively merges all `"_local"` sentinel entries:
- Replaces `"_local"` → real eid in `last_attacker` dict
- Merges `damage_dealt`, `first_dealt`, `last_dealt` from key `"_local"` into the real eid
- Merges `"_local"` encounter player entries (dealt, text_dealt, received, abilities) into real eid entries
- Flushes `_pending_local_dmg` queue

In UpdateHealth processing, any remaining `"_local"` in `last_attacker` is resolved to `_local_player_eid` as a safety net.

### `_mark_local_player` Guard

`_mark_local_player(eid)` **rejects** different eids once `_local_player_eid` is set — prevents NPC eids from overwriting the real local player. Only allows re-marking the same eid (for name refresh). The "YOU" fallback name is replaced when a real name becomes available.

### ClientPartyUpdate (0x0380)

Sent when a player does `/reload` in-game. Provides class/level/zone for all party members. Wire format (partially verified — still has parsing issues with string alignment):

```
[u32 member_count]
per member: [u32 entity_id] [u32 unknown] [LNL string name] [LNL string class_hid] [u8 level] [LNL string zone_hid]
[u32 leader_eid]
```

Handler sets `entity_types[eid] = 0` for all members, populates `classes`/`levels`/`names`, calls `_backfill_player_info()` to retroactively update encounter records. Also attempts local player detection via name matching when `_local_player_eid` is unknown.

## Entity Type System (parser/parser.py)

- `entity_types` dict: `eid → entity_type` (uint16 from SpawnEntity). `0` = player, `> 0` = NPC/pet, `None` = unknown (no SpawnEntity captured).
- `pet_states` dict: `eid → True` if SpawnEntity had `petState=True` (charmed/summoned pets).
- `_looks_like_npc_name(name)`: Returns `True` if name starts lowercase (e.g. "a bodyguard") or is "Entity#...". Used as heuristic to filter unknown entities.
- Party members get `entity_types[eid] = 0` from `ClientPartyUpdate`.
- Local player gets `entity_types[eid] = 0` from `_mark_local_player()`.

### Overview Filtering

The overview shows players + charmed pets, excluding regular NPCs. Inclusion rules:
- `entity_type == 0` → always included (player)
- `pet_states[eid] == True` → included, tagged `[PET]`
- `entity_type is None` (unknown) → included unless name looks like NPC, is an encounter target, or matches an encounter target name
- `entity_type > 0` and not pet → excluded (regular NPC)

### Class HID Mapping

`CLASS_HID_NAMES` dict maps 3-letter codes from SpawnEntity/ClientPartyUpdate to class names (e.g. `"dru"→"Druid"`, `"pal"→"Paladin"`, `"war"→"Warrior"`). `_class_label(hid)` returns the full name; unknown codes pass through as-is. `_scan_class_hid(hid_region)` extracts class codes from SpawnEntity HID region via ASCII byte scanning when standard string parsing fails.

## Encounter System (parser/parser.py)

`EntityTracker` maintains per-entity encounter records via `Encounter` objects keyed by entity ID in `_encounter_map`:

- **`total_damage`**: Sum of HP deltas from `UpdateHealth` messages (can be percentage-based for tough NPCs with max_hp=100)
- **`text_damage`**: Sum of damage numbers extracted from combat text (always real damage values)
- **`best_damage`**: `max(text_damage, total_damage)` — displayed in the UI
- **`players`** dict: Per-attacker breakdown with `dealt` (HP-based) and `text_dealt` (text-based)

### NPC Encounters

Created when `entity_type != 0` (NPC or unknown). Entities with unknown type (no SpawnEntity captured) are assumed NPC — this can cause false encounters for other players whose spawn wasn't captured.

SpawnEntity messages only retire an existing encounter from `_encounter_map` if the entity **name has changed** (real eid reuse by a different mob). Repeated SpawnEntity for the same entity (pets, mobs moving in/out of view range) preserves the encounter mapping.

### PvP Encounters

Created when both target and attacker are `entity_type == 0` (both players). PvP encounters appear in the encounter list alongside NPC encounters and support the same detail view with per-player damage breakdown.

The PvP system gates text damage resolution on encounter existence: `_resolve_target_eid`, the ChatCombat HP-correlation path, and the `_pending_chat_dmg` flush all allow player targets **only if** a PvP encounter already exists in `_encounter_map`. This prevents ambient player HP updates from creating ghost PvP encounters — the encounter must first be established by a confirmed player-on-player `UpdateHealth` damage event (logged as `ENC_PVP`).

## GUI Layout (parser/parser.py)

### Window Sizing (1080p optimized)

- Default (left panel collapsed): `425x300`, minsize `350x220`
- Expanded (both panels): `850x300`, minsize `600x220`
- Left panel starts hidden — user clicks expand arrow to show it

### Left Panel Views

Dropdown (`_left_combo`) switches between views. `_left_view` state values:

| Dropdown Label | `_left_view` value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Feed | `"feed"` | Real-time scrolling combat log, color-coded by event type |
| Items | `"items"` | Clickable item drop list with stats preview |
| (item click) | `"item_detail"` | Full item stats, effects, drop history |
| Triggers | `"triggers"` | User-defined text pattern matching with audio alerts (`triggers.json`) |
| Experience | `"experience"` | XP gain tracking per kill with session summary |

Copy button copies text from whichever view is active. Export button exports to CSV.

### Right Panel Views

Dropdown (`_meter_combo`) switches between views. `_meter_view` state values:

| Dropdown Label | `_meter_view` value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Overview | `"overview"` | Session leaderboard — top players ranked by total damage with expandable ability breakdown |
| Encounters | `"encounters"` | Live/dead NPC encounter list sorted by recency |
| (encounter click) | `"encounter_detail"` | Per-player damage breakdown for one encounter |
| Grand Overview | `"grand_overview"` | Aggregated stats across all encounters |

Overview uses in-place button label updates via `_overview_structure` tracking (prevents flicker). Full redraw only on structural change (new player, expand/collapse, rank reorder). `_overview_expanded` set tracks which players have ability breakdowns expanded.

## Item Tracker (parser/parser.py)

- **Data**: `CaptureBackend` stores `_items` (hid → full ItemRecord dict) and `_item_drops` (list of `{hid, name, quantity, timestamp, npc_name}`). Thread-safe via `_item_lock`.
- **Item list**: Clickable rows showing item name, count, and compact stats preview (DMG/AC/primary stats). Sorted by drop count descending.
- **Item detail**: Full stats view — HID, type/slot/level, flags (MAGIC/NO DROP/UNIQUE), damage/AC, primary stats, HP/mana/regen, haste, resists, weight, description, effects, and last 10 drop timestamps with NPC source names.
- **Refresh**: 1-second polling with fingerprint-based skip-redraw optimization (same pattern as encounter meter).
- **Loot context**: `_last_loot_target` maps entity ID → NPC name so items can be associated with the mob that dropped them.

Items are also queued to the API client when `api_enabled` is true.

## Experience Tracking (parser/parser.py)

`UpdateExperience (0x0024)`: `[u32 entity_id] [u32 experience]` — XP value is **per-level progress** (not lifetime total). Resets to near-zero on level-up.

- **State**: `_xp_current` (eid → last XP), `_xp_events` (list of gain records), `_xp_level_start` (eid → XP at level start), `_xp_level_needed` (eid → XP cap for level), `_xp_player_level` (eid → level)
- **First event baseline**: First `UpdateExperience` in a session silently records the XP value and returns `None` — no event shown. Second kill onwards computes proper deltas.
- **Level-up detection**: When `new_xp < prev_xp`, the player leveled up. The old value becomes the level cap (`_xp_level_needed`). XP percentage is computed from this.
- **NPC correlation (shifted by one)**: The XP delta computed at kill N is from kill N-1 (off-by-one in server timing). Each UpdateExperience resolves the current NPC via `_last_hp_eid` / dead encounter fallback but saves it in `_xp_pending_npc` for the NEXT event. The baseline event (first kill) saves its NPC; the second kill's delta is attributed to the baseline's NPC; and so on. This ensures the XP gain is always tagged to the mob that actually produced it.
- **Display**: Summary shows total gained + kill count + XP/hour. Event rows show timestamp, `+N XP`, percentage if known, and mob name.

## Trigger System (parser/parser.py)

User-defined text pattern alerts stored in `parser/triggers.json` (ships empty `[]`).

- **Matching**: Case-insensitive substring match against every combat text message (EndCasting, ChatCombat, Die, etc.). `_trigger_counts` tracks match counts per pattern.
- **Sound**: Queued to `_trigger_sound_queue` (thread-safe), drained on GUI thread every 500ms via `winsound.PlaySound(SND_ASYNC)`. 10 built-in Windows system sounds available.
- **UI**: Pattern entry + sound dropdown + preview button. Shows live match counts per trigger.

## Rendering Optimization (parser/parser.py)

All panel views use **fingerprint-based skip-redraw**: `_meter_build_fingerprint()` builds a hashable tuple of current state. If unchanged from last render, the 1-second refresh cycle skips the view entirely.

Within the overview, a two-tier system prevents flicker:
1. **Fingerprint** (encounter-level totals) gates whether `_render_overview()` is called at all
2. **Structure key** (`_overview_structure`) tracks player order + expanded state + ability data. If structure matches, only player summary lines are updated in-place via `tag_ranges()`. Structure mismatch triggers full redraw.

The structure key includes ability `(name, damage)` tuples for expanded players, so real-time damage changes to abilities trigger a full redraw when expanded.

Encounter list uses the same pattern: `_enc_list_structure` tracks button eid sequence, in-place label updates when structure matches.

## API Client (parser/api_client.py)

`ApiClient` runs a background thread that batches and sends data to a remote API every N seconds (default 15). Imported only by `parser/parser.py`, not `core/`.

- **Queues**: `queue_combat_event()`, `queue_loot_event()`, `queue_item()` (deduped by HID), `queue_npc()` (deduped by name+class+level)
- **Auth**: HMAC-SHA256 signing with `X-API-Key`, `X-API-Timestamp`, `X-API-Signature` headers
- **Config**: `api_enabled`, `api_url`, `api_key`, `api_batch_interval` in `config.json`
- **Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, skips on auth errors

## IL2CPP Memory Layout

byte[] in memory: `[klass(8)] [monitor(8)] [bounds(8)] [length(4)] [pad(4)] [data...]` — array data at offset 0x20, length at 0x18. Il2CppClass static_fields pointer is at class+0xB8. Class name char* at class+0x10.

## SpawnEntity Parsing

`_parse_spawn_entity()` in `core/combat.py` uses **phased parsing with fallback**. The HID string fields (classHID, raceHID, sexHID) between name and health don't follow standard LiteNetLib uint16-len string format for NPCs — the sexHID offset reads as uint16 LE = 1024 which is invalid. The parser:

1. Tries sequential string reads for the HID section
2. On failure, scans ahead for the health/maxHealth stats block (`_find_stats_offset()` looks for two plausible consecutive int32 values)
3. Extracts class/sex codes from the raw HID region bytes via ASCII scanning (`_parse_hid_region()`)
4. Continues parsing stats, position, booleans, model data, and appearance arrays from the found offset

Each phase (identity, HID, stats, position, booleans, model, appearance) has independent error recovery so a failure in one section doesn't blank out later fields.

**Standalone parser note**: `parser/parser.py` has its own SpawnEntity parser with the same phased approach. Spawn HP from `_find_stats()` is unreliable (often misaligned, producing garbage like 3072/49920) — the standalone parser does NOT use spawn HP as the damage baseline. Instead, the first `UpdateHealth` message sets the real HP baseline.

## Build & Distribution (ZekParser.exe)

PyInstaller single-file build with `--noconsole` (no console window), `--uac-admin` (proper UAC elevation prompt), and `version_info.py` (embeds product metadata to reduce AV false positives). The exe is unsigned — tell users to add a Defender exclusion for `ZekParser.exe` or its folder.

### Debug Logging

`_setup_parser_log()` checks `getattr(sys, 'frozen', False)`:
- **`python parser/parser.py`** (dev): Full DEBUG logging to `parser/logs/parser_<timestamp>.log` (10MB rotating, 3 backups). All `_plog.debug(...)` calls active — covers damage attribution, encounter creation, entity resolution, ChatCombat parsing.
- **Frozen exe**: `NullHandler` + `CRITICAL` level — zero logging overhead.

### Crash Handling

The exe uses `--noconsole` so `print()`/`input()` do nothing. Crashes show a native Windows `MessageBoxW` with the traceback, and write `crash.log` next to the exe (via `_crash_log_dir()` which uses `os.path.dirname(sys.executable)` for frozen builds, not `__file__` which points to the PyInstaller temp dir). The admin check also uses a message box instead of printing.

## Important Gotchas

- CRC32c is at the **back** of the packet, not front
- AES is CBC mode with per-packet IV (first 16 bytes), not ECB
- .NET Aes defaults to PKCS7 padding — must unpad after decrypt
- TypeInfo RVA `88407256` decimal = `0x544FCD8` hex (previous wrong conversion caused key read failures)
- Game binds UDP to 0.0.0.0 — connection matching must use port-only fallback
- Logger must have `logger.setLevel(DEBUG)` set on the logger itself; handler-level filtering alone is insufficient
- `read_string()` strips trailing null byte since LiteNetLib includes it in the length count
- Console output strips BEL characters (`\x07`) to prevent Windows terminal beeping on decoded packet data
- Spawn packet HP values from `_find_stats()` scan are frequently wrong (misaligned byte reads produce multiples of 256) — never trust them as damage baselines
- `parser/parser.py` is intentionally self-contained with duplicated logic from `core/` — do not add imports from `core/`
- Melee auto-attack damage text ("You slash X for N damage") is in **ChatMessage (0x0040) channel 1**, NOT EndCasting (0x0056). Each melee hit sends 3 messages: `UpdateHealth` + `ChatMessage` + `0x644B` (animation). The 0x644B has both entity IDs and the verb but NOT the damage number — the damage value only exists in the ChatMessage English text
- ChatCombat messages have **no entity IDs** — target must be resolved by temporal correlation with the preceding `UpdateHealth`, not by name lookup (multiple NPCs share names)
- EndCasting text for non-combat actions ("Rainbow pulls you through a shimmering portal") will match broad verb patterns — use the `_MELEE_VERBS` whitelist, not `\w+`
- `config.json` `player_name` should be empty string `""` — the parser auto-detects it from outbound Autoattack/ChangeTarget packets and "Your..."/"You..." combat text patterns
- Never use `"_local"` string as a real entity ID — it's a sentinel placeholder for the local player before detection. Always resolve via `_local_player_eid` at consumption points and merge in `_mark_local_player`
- Wire format helpers in parser.py: `_r_u32`, `_r_i32`, `_r_u16`, `_r_u8`, `_r_bool`, `_r_float`, `_r_str` — all return `(value, new_offset)` or `(None, offset)` on bounds failure. `_r_str` auto-strips trailing null bytes from LNL strings
- ClientPartyUpdate (0x0380) string parsing may have alignment issues — the class_hid field has been observed including the level byte as a trailing character (e.g. "dru%" where 0x25=37=level). The wire format may not use standard LNL null-terminated strings for all fields in this opcode
